        <description>For the longest time, I thought about creating my own space where I can write whatever I want. Throughout the years I&amp;rsquo;ve written on Medium and Substack.
So why not use those instead?
Substack provided a good environment to post whatever I wanted. However, the issue I found with Substack was that it was difficult for people to find it. On the other hand, while, Medium has a wonderful community of readers and writers, there were some posts where I wanted to share half baked ideas without having to worry about feedback from others.</description>
