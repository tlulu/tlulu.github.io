        <description>A channel force closure is one of the most complex parts of Lightning in my opinion. This happens when one party isn&amp;rsquo;t cooperating with the other, resulting in the counterparty to initiate a force close. In addition, if one party decides to cheat another, then they need to be punished. The purpose of this post is to dive into the outputs and transactions of a force closure. This post will answer these questions:</description>

        <description>Happy Halvening day! The fees in the network as of writing this article is insane. So many inscriptions in this block.

        <description>For the longest time, I thought about creating my own space where I can write whatever I want. Throughout the years I&amp;rsquo;ve written on Medium and Substack.
So why not use those instead?
Substack provided a good environment to post whatever I wanted. However, the issue I found with Subastack was that it was difficult for people to find it. On the other hand, while, Medium has a wonderful community of readers and writers, there were some posts where I wanted to share half baked ideas without having to worry about feedback from others.</description>
