      <title>A Weekend of LLMs</title>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been late to exploring the generative AI space, but over Thanksgiving break, I decided to use an LLM to help me understand a challenging book I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading: The Human Condition by Hannah Arendt. This book is, without a doubt, one of the hardest books I.have.ever.read.. Its abstract ideas and Arendt&amp;rsquo;s extremely dense prose often leave me spending 10 minutes analyzing a single page. After weeks of making minimal progress, I wondered: could an LLM teach me?</description>

        <description>It took me forever to fully understand the intricacies of channel force closures. Sources online were either too high level or too specific about implementation details - this post aims to be an in-between. The content of this post dives into the transactions of a force closure. This post will answer specific questions like:
What are the outputs in a commitment transaction? What transactions will be broadcasted onchain? Cooperative Channel Close To start, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about cooperative channel closures, when life is roses and butterflies.</description>

        <description>Happy Halvening day! The fees in the network as of writing this article is insane. So many inscriptions in this block.

While the lightning network is being battle tested in the high fee environment, I want to point out another issue with lightning. A bigger and more fundamental issue that I don&amp;rsquo;t see many people talking about - stuck payments.</description>

        <description>For the longest time, I thought about creating my own space where I can write whatever I want. Throughout the years I&amp;rsquo;ve written on Medium and Substack.
So why not use those instead?
Substack provided a good environment to post whatever I wanted. However, the issue I found with Subastack was that it was difficult for people to find it. On the other hand, while, Medium has a wonderful community of readers and writers, there were some posts where I wanted to share half baked ideas without having to worry about feedback from others.</description>
