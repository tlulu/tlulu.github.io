        <description>Happy Halvening day! The fees in the network as of writing this article is insane. So many inscriptions in this block.

While the lightning network is being battle tested in the high fee environment, I want to point out another issue with lightning. A bigger and more fundamental issue that I don&amp;rsquo;t see many people talking about - stuck payments.</description>

        <description>For the longest time, I thought about creating my own space where I can write whatever I want. Throughout the years I&amp;rsquo;ve written on Medium and Substack.
So why not use those instead?
Substack provided a good environment to post whatever I wanted. However, the issue I found with Subastack was that it was difficult for people to find it. On the other hand, while, Medium has a wonderful community of readers and writers, there were some posts where I wanted to share half baked ideas without having to worry about feedback from others.</description>
